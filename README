This repository contains (will contain) versions of lib3ds that I
modified to store/use extra information in 3DS files. The extra
information are: per vertex normals, per vertex skinning information,
extra material parameters, and an extra texture coordinate pair.

I have a proprietary 3ds file handler that I use in my own software, but
I am adding support for the extra information to lib3ds in hopes that 
it will eventually get wider use. In particular by AC3D and MeshLab, which
I use to tweak meshes. AC3D seems to use lib3ds 1.2.0, so the master branch
will remain that version. 1.3.0 and 2.0.0-rc1 versions will be in their own
branches.

lib3ds is licensed under the LGPL, so these versions are as well. However
the extra information / my changes may be used in other 3ds file handlers,
whether open or closed source, with or without attributation.

As I said earlier, I have proprietary software that I use to read/write 3DS
files in my own software, so these lib3ds versions will not be well tested.



The original lib3ds readme is below:

Lib3ds is a free alternative to Autodesk's 3DS File Toolkit for handling 
3DS files Its main goal is to simplify the creation of 3DS import and 
export filters. 

This project is not related in any form to Autodesk. The library is 
based on unofficial information about the 3DS format found on the web.
